.mld (ModeL Data) file format reference

Syntax:
"$structure"
{
	"$tag" "value"
}

NOTE: structure and tags always start with "$"

Structure: this is a data structure that defines something within the model, or even the model itself (see: $model)
Tag: A key to some part of the structure

List of structures:
$model					- the model itself, should only be used once
$text					- defines a GUI text object that will be associated to this mesh
$image					- defines a GUI image object that will be associated to this mesh

References will not use all tags, some tags will be ignored

List of tags:
$field					- defines a reference to a model field (basically a hashmap of strings)
$texture				- defines a texture to the structure, or a default texture to use if defined in $model
$scale					- defines a scale for the structure, relative to the mesh's scale in worldspace
$offset					- defines a position for the structure, relative to the mesh's position in worldspace
$nolighting				- to be used in $model only, if set to 1 the model will ignore the ambient lightmap
